# Movie Inventory App

## [Live Demo](http://inventory-app-erinsophie.netlify.app)

## Frontend

- React
- Tailwind

## Backend

- Node
- Express
- MongoDB

# Goal

To create an inventory of items that allows users to perform CRUD operations.

## Node, Express, MongoDB

This simple inventory app was perfect for practicing CRUD and I feel like I have a much better understanding of how mongoose and express work as a whole.

## Client Side + Server Side Routing

I defined routes on the client side using react-router-dom and combined this with navigation on the server side with Express. I got to understand how both of these types of routing can be utilised together in one project.
